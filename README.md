# matsci495_finalproject_mat2vec
Final project for Chris Wolverton's MSE 495: Materials Informatics class; comparison of Mat2Vec and Word2Vec trained on a standard corpus (Google News 300).

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
Download the Mat2Vec supplementary data [from GitHub](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec/tree/master). Place the unzipped folder in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

## Competencies Developed
This project was created and envisioned to be turned into a course assignment for future class iterations; students who complete the assignment should be able to:
 - Understand basic terminology about natural language processing (corpora, tokenization, embeddings)
 - Learn how training models with different data sets results in different performance on the same tasks
 - Evaluate the performance of a natural language processing model using linguistic (analogies) and scientific (materials prediction) tasks
 - Explore the extraction of “latent knowledge” in scientific abstracts
